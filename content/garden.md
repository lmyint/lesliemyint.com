## Entry points

If you want to get an idea of what is constantly on my mind, take a look at my [[12 Favorite Problems]] to start.

- ðŸŒ¶ Books and articles (linear knowledge forms) are poor forms for *safeguarding* knowledge. On this front, I think a lot about [[Graph-based knowledge representations]].
    - Note: I'm not saying that we shouldn't use books and articles to communicate information. We shouldn't **ONLY** use books and articles. Graph-based representations are the future.
- As a college educator, I think a lot about [[Teaching and learning]] and ways that they can be inspirational, joyful, and effective for both students and teachers.
- What makes [[A beautiful life]]?

Other essays that I need to make an entry point for:

- [[The Book of Why]]
- [[Dungeons and Dragons Web Scraping with rvest and RSelenium]]
