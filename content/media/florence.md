[Florence](https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/florence) is a minimalistic story game that follows Florence Yeoh, a young woman down on her life, through her relationship with a musician named Krish.

What I found most intriguing about the game was the use of varied mechanics to evoke emotion throughout the story:
- In a dialogue sequence between Florence and Krish, we fill in the dialogue bubbles with puzzle pieces. At first there are many pieces to the puzzle, evoking the feeling that conversation is a bit more effortful initially. By the end, there are only two pieces to the puzzle, evoking the growing ease of talking to someone loved.
- **SPOILER:** <span style="color: black; background-color: black;">After Florence and Krish break up, there is a chapter in which Florence is walking along a sidewalk with an outline of Krish behind her. He slowly fades as the distance between them separates. There are no instructions on how to interact in this game. Curious, I clicked, and this caused Florence to pause and Krish's outline to become fully dark again. I loved the way that this chapter was told.</span>

In addition to the mechanics, the soundtrack to this game was beautiful.

I found [this Steam review](https://steamcommunity.com/id/neizod/recommended/1102130/) helpful in putting the game into perspective and for recommending other games of a similar style.
