Teaching is as much about the teacher as it is the students. I came to deeply appreciate this after reading [[books/the courage to teach|The Courage to Teach]] by Parker Palmer. My Substack essay [Who is the teacher that teaches?](https://lesliemyint.substack.com/p/who-is-the-teacher-that-teaches) explores some crucial aspects of my identity that have shaped how I approached teaching in the past and how I want to approach it in the future.

One of the scariest questions to ask in a room full of teachers is "What are we even doing?" Is what we're doing in the classroom having the effects that we want?

What impacts do *I* want?

It feels like I'm supposed to say that I want my students to gain an appreciation for statistics.

I'm not going to contradict that. That *is* something that I would be happy about. But is that it?

In the Afterword to [[books/the courage to teach|The Courage to Teach]], Parker Palmer raises a provocative proposal for what we might wish for our students:

> I have five immodest proposals regarding the education of a new professional:
> 1. We must help our students debunk the myth that institutions possess autonomous, even ultimate, power over our lives.
> 2. We must validate the importance of our students' emotions as well as their intellect.
> 3. We must teach our students how to "mine" their emotions for knowledge.
> 4. We must teach them how to cultivate community for the sake of both knowing and doing.
> 5. We must teach—and model for—our students what it means to be on the journey toward "an undivided life."

What strikes me about these proposals is how they are so obviously not just about domain content. 

If I had to put my wish for students into one goal, it would be this: I wish for you to gain the capacity to care for yourselves enough that you know when it's time to focus on caring for others.
