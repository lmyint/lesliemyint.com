Much of the writing on my Substack centers on living a more beautiful life. My favorites:
- [Don't ask for permission](https://lesliemyint.substack.com/p/dont-ask-for-permission)
- [Wait for the turn-around](https://lesliemyint.substack.com/p/wait-for-the-turn-around)

Essays that are not on my Substack:
- [[lightning lure|Lightning lure]]
- [[twin brushstrokes of my marriage and career|The twin brushstrokes of my marriage and career]]
- [[annual review 2022|Annual Review 2022]]
