Much of the writing on my Substack centers on living a more beautiful life. My favorites:
- [Don't ask for permission](https://lesliemyint.substack.com/p/dont-ask-for-permission)
- [Wait for the turn-around](https://lesliemyint.substack.com/p/wait-for-the-turn-around)

Essays that are not on my Substack:
- [Lightning lure](lightning%20lure.md)
- [The twin brushstrokes of my marriage and career](twin%20brushstrokes%20of%20my%20marriage%20and%20career.md)
- [Annual Review 2022](annual%20review%202022.md)
