Today I listened to [This is Water](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/), David Foster Wallace's 2005 commencement speech at Kenyon College. I believe that I heard about it from Write of Passage the first time I took it but forgot about it until now.

It is a really good speech.

To be awake, conscious of our ability to choose *what* to think in any given moment. *That* is the real power of a good education.

I think I had heard some negative inklings about David Foster Wallace so I looked up his [biography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace) and learned that he had some abusive issues with a partner. 

I've heard from my colleagues at Macalester that it's so important to think about public figures as full humans with flaws. I thought about this because seeing this part of his life made me question whether I should share This is Water with my students. But I think what my Mac colleagues are saying is that no one is perfect and that we can still learn from someone despite this.
