# Evolution

I first learned about the 12 Favorite Problems framework when first taking [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.com/) in late 2021. When this framework was introduced during the first live session, I was captivated.

The following were my original 12 Favorite Problems:

1. How can I truly reach every student without burning out?
2. How can we make inspiring and successful education available to everyone?
3. How can I be the best mother I can be while maintaining my own well-being?
4. How do I contribute to a fulfilling marriage for me and my husband?
5. What do I owe the world?
6. What can I do to help safeguard human knowledge?
7. How can I convince others to take meaningful action without forcing them or being preachy?
8. How can I maintain a clear vision of what truly matters and let go of what doesnâ€™t?
9. How can I find the strength to change myself when it matters most?
10. How can we fix the way science is conducted and funded?
11. How can we create a more data-minded society?
12. How can I infuse the best parts of games into all that I do?

Much of the spirit in these questions remains in my current 12FPs, but I find it interesting to leave a record of my thoughts over time to see how I've changed.
