People working on AI to improve education
- [Ying Xu](https://ying-xu.com/research/) works on interesting research in human-computer interaction that focuses on using AI to build tools that promote learning.
- [Zach Pardos](https://bse.berkeley.edu/leveraging-ai-improve-adaptive-tutoring-systems) works on using AI to build and improve intelligent tutoring systems.

I'd love to see the above tools in action to get a sense for how they work and how students *feel* when using them.

Institutional collaborations with AI
- ASU and OpenAI started a [partnership](https://www.chronicle.com/article/arizona-state-and-openai-are-now-partners-what-does-that-mean) in early 2024 ([ASU site](https://ai.asu.edu/AI-Innovation-Challenge)) to spur innovation. OpenAI is providing free ChatGPT licenses to teams who submit quality project proposals.
