Grading...what a beast! It is an immense and complex topic that touches on what it means to be a good teacher

# What do I want for my students?

(What I wish for that is mostly under *their* control)
- To take a risk, to step out of their comfort zone
    - In learning a new subject that they had negative inclinations toward or had no idea about. In letting themselves be vulnerable enough to be curious.
    - In connecting with others who they might be unsure about. To be curious about the life of someone who they would probably not be friends with normally.

(What I wish for that is mostly under *my* control)
- To connect authentically with my students

# The 4 pillars of alternative grading

Robert Talbert and David Clark from the [Grading for Growth blog](https://gradingforgrowth.com) propose these pillars in [this post](https://gradingforgrowth.com/p/finding-common-ground-with-grading):

## Clearly defined standards

It's hard to disagree with this one. Having a set of clearly defined standards is useful for both students and the instructor.
- For the instructor, it gives clarity on the vision for the course.
- For the student, it gives clarity on where to focus their efforts and what the big picture is. Reviewing the course learning objectives as a whole can help students 

This reminds me of a moment during the Johns Hopkins Summer Teaching Institute. We were learning about course-level learning objectives and lesson-level learning objectives, and they were saying that lesson-level learning objectives needed to be written in an action-verb oriented way to be assessable. I asked if course-level learning objectives needed to be assessable too. The workshop leaders said, "No, they're just for guiding the focus of the course." While I agree that course-level objectives are useful for that purpose, why can't they be part of an assignment that gets assessed?

> [!tip] Assignment Idea
> Have students review the course-level and lesson-level learning objectives at the end of the semester and explain how the lesson-level objectives link to the course-level objectives.

## Helpful feedback

Fully on board with this one. Qualitative feedback is my preferred method. Insights from the *Feedback in Small Shifts* session at SPAW 2023:

## Marks indicate progress

In [this post](https://gradingforgrowth.com/p/giving-marks-that-indicate-progress), Robert Talbert digs into this pillar more. After reflecting on ungrading and the benefits of qualitative feedback, Robert adds this caveat:

> So interpret the third pillar as _If you give marks at all, they should indicate progress._

In my Spring 2024 Epidemiology course, I used a 3 mark scale for individual homework problems: fully correct / mostly correct with minor errors / revision encouraged. Each problem was given one of these 3 marks by my preceptors. If a student received a *revision encouraged* on any of the problems, they would earn a *Not Yet* mark on the homework. Otherwise (for any combination of *fully correct* and *mostly correct with minor errors*) they earned a *Pass* on the homework.

I absolutely did not have the time to read all of my students' homework, so I had to trust that my preceptors were doing a good job. From glancing at their comments and marks, I was generally ok with their feedback. But I did get feedback from one student in my course evaluation that this 3 mark system combined with the Pass / Not Yet mark on the homework didn't motivate them to look carefully at problems that were *mostly correct with minor errors* if they received a Pass overall. Totally fair.

When I taught Machine Learning in the module system, I gave take-home quizzes that were on a 4 point scale, which was a lot like Robert Talbert's EMRN rubric:

## Reattempts without penalty

This has been a mainstay in my grading systems ever since I 

I do want to note that "reattempts without penalty" means "reattempts without *direct* penalty *on your grade*" and NOT "reattempts without constraints". Because the reality is that the instructional team absolutely has constraints on their time. These constraints might make it so that a student is not able to demonstrate the highest level of understanding within the reattempts that the instructional team has time for.

From Robert's [post](https://gradingforgrowth.com/p/the-heart-of-the-loop-reattempts):

> Does allowing reattempts without penalty lead to grade inflation? **Not really**. "Grade inflation" refers to increases in grade levels _without a corresponding increase in the quality of the work_. That second part is key; simply having higher grades by itself isn’t grade inflation. Reassessments let students demonstrate that they have actually learned. When we allow reassessments without penalty, grades do tend to increase, but they are tied to concrete evidence of improvements in learning. This isn't "inflation" — it's _accuracy_, and [validity](https://gradingforgrowth.com/p/moving-on-from-rigor?s=w).

> But I do want to stress that "reassessments without penalty" does _not_ mean **reassessment without responsibility**. While we shouldn't penalize growth, we can design our courses so that students don't take the reassessment opportunities the wrong way.
> 
> Instead of penalizing, you can **place reasonable limits on reassessment opportunities**.

We can limit the number, schedule, and frequency (e.g., one problem per week) or reassessments.
