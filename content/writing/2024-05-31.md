[Mathematics for Human Flourishing](writing/books/mathematics%20for%20human%20flourishing.md)

Christopher Jackson's letter to Francis at the end of Chapter 1 tugs at my heart. What a gift to receive a letter like that. 

In the Preface and Chapter 1, Francis does with grace what all of us with passions want to do: share them with others. He asks the reader, gently, to take a journey with them--one where he can show beauty. He acknowledges objections ("So you're saying that math is the ultimate virtuous pursuit?") with grace.
