Today I read [this article](https://danmeyer.substack.com/p/colin-campbell-teaches-the-95) by Dan Meyer and focused on the video of a summer school teacher interacting with a single student and a class. I was amazed by the artful presence of the teacher (Colin Campbell). He identified a student who was likely in need of uplifting from a full classroom, engaged with genuine curiosity about the student's math story, asked him if he could share with the class, engaged the whole class with the story ("Can you imagine how big a bowl would be needed to hold 12 cups of flour??"). It was really cool to watch. Good teachers are really cool to watch. It was amazing to see how in tune he was with the room.
