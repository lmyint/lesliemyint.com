Yesterday was the one day that I didn't put digital gardening first on my priority list.

And it didn't happen.

I told myself that I would get to it after I finished the main big thing that I wanted to accomplish. I finished that thing, but then it was dinner prep, dinner, picking up Margaux, bedtime for her, then bedtime for me.

I learned that I do need to put this first. But I've noticed that lately I've just been picking the latest newsletter in my inbox (or sometimes looking through the most popular posts from those newsletter authors) and just pasting quotes that I like. I haven't been using these daily notes as *thinking time*, which is what I value most about this practice.

So I set up a plan to devote a day each week to synthesizing my most recent notes--that was supposed to be the plan yesterday, but it didn't happen. 

I worked on my [[writing/saving the world|saving the world]] note to accompany my first [[writing/favorite problems|favorite problem]]. The words and ideas flowed quickly and naturally. This is what I like about the process. Let's try this again tomorrow.
