I'm scared of change.
But the change that I fear is a *might*.
And change is a *future* thing.
What about the *certain* and the *now*?
Can I just fully love the now without the fear?
But I'm scared.
Remember dialectical thinking. Both and.
I'm scared. And.
There is so much to be grateful for *right now*.
Can I switch to giving mode?
To not worry about what I *might* lose.
And focus on loveâ€”love that can fuel a fountain of giving.
Both feelings together.
