Today I read Erik Hoel's [Academia is dangerously close to "network or perish"](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/is-academia-now-network-or-perish). Ultimately his point was that the people who make it to the most prestigious positions do not always write the best content. His main example was a short op-ed in *TIME* called "No, Today's AI Isn't Sentient." This whole piece was inspired by a viral tweet about a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist about her distaste for the kinds of networking that were required to succeed in her position.

I thought his piece would deliver more than it did, but it did still make me think about the privilege of having a job as an academic to pursue the projects that I want. And I am grateful for that.
