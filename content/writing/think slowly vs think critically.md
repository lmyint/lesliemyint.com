Critical thinking shows up everywhere in education goals. What do we even mean by thinking critically? Thinking like a critic? Critiquing is a rather negative-oriented framework. There is a lot to be gained from thinking about the positive aspects of a piece of work.

"Thinking slowly" seems like a better descriptor of what we want because I think what we really want is the capacity and desire to carefully examine many aspects of a problem, which is necessarily a slow process!
