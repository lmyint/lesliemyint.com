Saving the world has been on my mind a lot recently. Whenever the feelings surrounding this aspiration are strongest, I'm picturing my daughter. As the toddler she is now, reveling in the joy of bubble wands and Play-Doh. As an adolescent, with uncertainty about the future. With hope too? As an adult, thinking about the trajectory of her life both behind and ahead of her. As a mother? As a partner? What will her worries be when she gets older? What will she value and think of the world? Will she have on her mind as much as I do whether the world will be there for her and her children?

I'm being over-dramatic, for sure, when I wonder whether the world will be there for her as an adult, but it signals a problem in the world that is very present for me right now: the destruction of the environment. The depletion of natural resources, the massive amounts of waste that pollute landfills or get incinerated and harm communities, sea level rise, climate change. I get the impression from *Generation Dread* that the destruction of the environment is a source of dread for the younger generation. 

When I think about saving the world, I also think about pervasive unhappiness (unwholeness?), lack of meaning, and struggle in solitude. Anywhere I see someone just going through the motions, lamenting their career, or struggling with aspects of their lives, the idea of saving the world comes to mind.

Perhaps when I think about saving the world, I think about saving people enough that they can care about something bigger than themselvesâ€”that bigger thing could be their neighborhood, their city, the earth, a cause. As Elle Griffin points out in [Who's qualified to save the world?](https://www.elysian.press/p/who-is-qualified-to-save-the-world), *everyone* can be a savior, and the world very much needs more people to have that mindset.

Because the reality is that there is *so much* to saving the world. The problems that are top of mind for me are just some of the ways in which the world is messed up. Convincing others that my favorite problems are the most important is not the way to empower others to make meaningful change. Everyone needs to discover for themselves what saving the world means to them. Maybe everyone is already working to save the world in some way.

But how can we be a community in saving the world in our individual ways?
