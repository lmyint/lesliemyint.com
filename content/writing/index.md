I've been a daydreamer all my life. I love letting an idea perch on the leaves of my consciousness and linger for me to examine from all sides.

Before I discovered the power of a writing practice, I would often have the same daydreams and think about the same ideas over and over again without fully capturing the scope of my thoughts, discovering new ideas, or making connections.

This digital garden allows me to do just that.

By writing, I gently tuck my ideas into the earth as seeds so that roots can take hold. Some of those seeds will flourish into flowers that I want to share with others. But many will just take root, intertwine, and sprout into chaos that I'll eventually have to cull away.

The best way to explore the garden is to take a look at my [[writing/favorite problems|favorite problems]]. My favorite problems are a set of the biggest questions on my mind and serve as a bird's eye view of my writing. You'll find links to specific topics on that page.

If you want to peek into my messy stream of consciousness, take a look at my [[writing/daily seeds|daily seeds]].
