I've been a daydreamer all my life. I love letting an idea perch on the leaves of my consciousness and linger for me to examine from all sides.

Before I discovered the power of a writing practice, I would often have the same daydreams and think about the same ideas over and over again without fully capturing the scope of my thoughts, discovering new ideas, or making connections.

This digital garden allows me to do just that.

By writing, I gently tuck my ideas into the earth as seeds so that roots can take hold. Some of those seeds will flourish into flowers that I want to share with others. But many will just take root, intertwine, and sprout into chaos. And I wouldn't have it any other way.

If you want to peek into my stream of consciousness, take a look at my [[daily seeds]]. 

If you want to explore a more curated collection of ideas, take a look at the entry points below:

- **What are the biggest questions on my mind?** Take a look at my [[12 favorite problems]]. If any of these resonate with you, let's connect!
- **How can learning be inspirational, joyful, and effective for students? How can teaching be inspirational, joyful, and fulfilling for teachers?** Take a look at my [[teaching and learning]] page.
- **How can I nurture a healthy soul?** What are the parts of [[a beautiful life]]?
- **Can we do better than books?** Books and articles (linear knowledge forms) are poor forms for *safeguarding* knowledge. On this front, I think a lot about [[graph-based knowledge representations]].
