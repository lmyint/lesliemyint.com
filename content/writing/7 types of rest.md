Dr. Saundra Dalton-Smith writes about 7 types of rest in [this article](https://ideas.ted.com/the-7-types-of-rest-that-every-person-needs/). I learned about this from Macalester's Spring Professional Activities Workshop in May 2024 during a session led by [Benita Jackson](https://restingtorise.com/)

- **Physical:** This includes both sleep and things like stretching, massage. 
- **Mental:** Breaks from work.
- **Sensory:** Breaks from stimuli like screens, big crowds, multiple conversation, socializing.
- **Creative:** For reawakening inspiration
    > This type of rest is especially important for anyone who must solve problems or brainstorm new ideas. Creative rest reawakens the awe and wonder inside each of us.
- **Emotional:** Times where we take off our masks and have the courage to be ourselves without worrying about pleasing others
- **Social:** Times where we surround ourselves with people who energize us instead of drain us.
- **Spiritual:** Times where we can connect with others and the world beyond the physical and mental to achieve a deep sense of belonging, love, acceptance, and purpose.
