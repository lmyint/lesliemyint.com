ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Leslie.

I teach statistics at Macalester College with [awesome mathematicians, computer scientists, statisticians, and data scientists](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/) as colleagues.

I have a secret subversive plan to make academia as joyful, meaningful, and giving as a campaign of Dungeons and Dragons. To do that, I [[garden|write]].

Welcome to my digital garden, coconspirator.
