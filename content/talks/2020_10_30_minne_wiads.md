**Abstract:** Staying up to date on the relevant results and methodology in our fields is crucial for doing our best work but can be challenging if the literature is vast. There are myriad ways in which people try to organize this information, from note taking to simply remembering. However, as the literature grows, it is not clear that these approaches are sustainable for most people. In this talk, I'll discuss how knowledge graphs, as implemented by graph databases, provide another alternative. Graph databases have the advantage of encouraging careful thought about how pieces of information are connected and also provide a means of performing computations on that information. In this talk, I'll introduce key ideas about graph databases and a use case in organizing information from statistical research literature.
